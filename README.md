# Time-series-forecasting-and-Scoring

### Brief Summary
This project is part of my grad project thesis. I explore a business data base where the challenge is to:
* Create a score that qulifies the customer payment quality
* A machine that can forecast customer payment quality

### Strategy
In order to address the subject:
* Data exploration and modeling
* Score modeling
* Score exploration
* Time series modeling exploration (Holt-Winters Exponential smoothing, ARIMA, SVR, and LSTM)
* Predictions and conclusions
